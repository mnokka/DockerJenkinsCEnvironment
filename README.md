POC to setup Jenkins in Docker able to build C code.
<br>
<br>

Start docker: *docker-compose up -d*

Use: *localhost:8080*

Jenkins goes directly to admin state...

Jenkins has pipeline job (for project/hello.c) defined, just hit Build button to build it (output hello will be tested(executed) and archived)
